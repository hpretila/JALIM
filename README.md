# JALIM
This is repo for a language interpreter for JALIM (Just Another Language In MATLAB), a C-like language in MATLAB/Octave. Was made as a project for a MATLAB course, when I realised there wasn't enough time to draw sprites for an anime visual novel.

## Testing
The driver checks major preprocessing functions, and general language functionality. Test cases for code can be found in Test/testcases.txt, and can be input through JalimCLI.m. Code has been tested in Octave 5.2.0 and MATLAB R2019a.
